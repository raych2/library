# Library 
It's a simple library app that follows the project guidelines listed in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library) JavaScript curriculum. Click 'Add New Book' to trigger a modal to add a book you've read or are planning to read.  The book is saved to localStorage.  Alternatively, you can login using your Google account to save your books on the Cloud Firestore database instead of localStorage. Lastly, you have the options to update your read status and delete the book.
